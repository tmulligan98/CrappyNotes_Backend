# CrappyNotes_Backend

## What is this?
This is the backend of CrappyNotes - A multi-faceted note taking tool that I want to make. 
The backend itself includes:
- A database
- A thin database wrapper
- A restful API servicing requests

## Current work
1. Build the routers to provide the required services
    - Fetch 10 most recent notes
    - Add a note
    - Delete a note via key



    - Authenticate
